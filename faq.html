												<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
											</header>

											<section>
											<p><strong>What is Home Watch?</strong></br>
											Home Watch is known by many names: house watch, house check, home concierge, caretaker, absentee home service, property watch, and so on. Regardless of the name, a Home Watch service performs scheduled inspections of “vacant” properties while the owner is away.</br>
											These inspections include a basic check of plumbing, electrical, and HVAC systems, as well as the overall condition of the home and property. Home Watch inspectors look at the house or condominium with a trained eye, making sure that everything is satisfactory. They look for leaks, pests and mold, all of which can be present in homes left alone for even the shortest interval.</br></br>
											<strong>What do you do if you find a problem with my home?</strong></br>
											Should the inspector find an issue or potential problem, they will immediately notify the homeowner. From there, the issue can be resolved by either the Home Watch service itself, or the homeowner will instruct the Home Watch service on how they want to proceed. Home Watch is the line of communication to the homeowner that provides peace of mind during their absence. We have a vetted list of contractors in every field should a problem arise (i.e. our contractor database).</br></br>
											<strong>So, are you a security company?</strong></br>
     										No we are not. Simply put a home that is well monitored with scheduled traffic is less likely to be vandalized, we will notify you and the authorities if we see evidence of intrusion.</br></br>
											<strong>So what is the difference between you and a property management company?</strong></br>
											A property management company takes a significant slice of your vacation home properties profit and handles the responsibility of finding ,screening, evicting tenants as well as rent collections. Many homeowners who use services like Air B&B, VRBO or simply need an occasional service or limited services and find a homewatch company is more cost effective.</br></br>
											<strong>How long have you been in business?</strong></br>
   											Our family has been involved in every aspect of the Real Estate Industry since 1990. KDC Home Protective Services was formed in June of 2017 in both Florida and Washington states. The Corporate office is Fort Myers, Florida-with branches in Tampa, Florida and Spokane Washington. We are easily searchable as registered corps on both stateand government sites.</br></br>
	 										<strong>Are you a franchise?</strong></br>
 											No. We are family owned and supervised in three locations. </br></br>
 											<strong>Are you Insured?</strong></br>
											KDC Home Protection Services carries dishonesty bonds and full commercial liability insurance.</br></br>
											<strong>What does NHWA accredited mean?</strong></br>
											Most Home Watch companies do not qualify for membership in the National Home Watch Association. We have been carefully screened. References have been checked and insurance, bonding and licenses have been verified. We have agreed to abide by our Code of Ethics and set of standards.</br></br>
											<strong>Why shouldn't I just ask a neighbor to check on my home?</strong></br>
											We have seen owners using “Neighbors Doing Favors” programs only to discover that  homes had been left unlocked for weeks; on other occasions a ruptured exterior water line spewed forth water for days until someone finally noticed and called the owner.  Keep your friends and neighbors as friends and neighbors and leave the well being of your home to us.</br></br>
											<strong>I am a Realtor, how can you benefit me?</strong></br>
											We love our Realtors! We have developed a special package for you to give as a closing gift to your vacation home buyers, a prepaid 3 visit homewatch package for $99.00 dollars. We often come into contact with owners looking to sell their property-so we invite you to get to know us so we may refer your services as well.</br></br>
											<strong>What other services to you provide?</strong></br>
											We have a growing list of concierge services and in most cases if it is not a service we provide we can coordinate with are list of vetted service providers to accommodate your needs. <a href="http://houndsathometampa.com/" target="_blank">(Currently our Tampa branch has partnered with a pet sitting company).</a></br></br>
